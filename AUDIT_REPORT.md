# AMET Alumni Portal Feature Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a comprehensive audit of the AMET Alumni Portal codebase to identify features, components, tables, or APIs that potentially exceed the scope defined in the approved Alumni Management Plan. The audit involved detailed examination of frontend components, backend functions, database schema, and external integrations to detect any unauthorized features or functionalities.

## Audit Scope

The audit covered:
- Database schema review (tables, columns, relationships)
- Frontend components and pages
- Backend serverless functions
- Authentication systems
- Third-party integrations
- Security features

## Potential Out-of-Scope Features

### 1. OAuth Social Authentication

**Details:**
- Google and LinkedIn OAuth login options are implemented in `Login.js` and `supabase.js`
- Includes social login buttons in the UI
- Utilizes Supabase authentication for handling OAuth flows

**Code Location:**
- `/frontend/src/components/Auth/Login.js` 
- `/frontend/src/utils/supabase.js` (functions: `signInWithGoogle`, `signInWithLinkedIn`)

**Recommendation:**
- Flag for review: Determine if social login options were approved in the Alumni Management Plan
- If not approved: Consider disabling these login options by removing the buttons and related functionality

### 2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**Details:**
- Sophisticated 2FA implementation with QR code generation
- Recovery keys management
- Supports enabling/disabling 2FA
- Serverless functions for verification

**Code Location:**
- `/frontend/src/components/Auth/TwoFactorAuth.js`
- Referenced serverless functions: `generate-2fa-secret`, `verify-2fa-code`, `generate-recovery-keys`

**Recommendation:**
- Flag for review: Determine if advanced security features like 2FA were part of the approved plan
- If not approved: Consider simplifying to basic authentication or making 2FA an optional admin-controlled feature

## Features Within Approved Scope

### 1. Mentor Matching System

**Details:**
- Simple scoring algorithm based on matching expertise and industry
- No AI/ML or advanced recommendation algorithms
- Basic filtering and sorting logic only
- Transparent matching criteria

**Code Location:**
- `/supabase/functions/mentor-matching/index.ts`

**Conclusion:** The mentor matching implementation uses a straightforward scoring system without advanced AI/ML techniques, keeping it within the typical scope of a standard alumni management system.

### 2. Event Management

**Details:**
- Standard event creation, editing, and attendance tracking
- Support for both free and paid events, but no payment processing implementation
- Simple RSVP functionality
- Event feedback collection

**Code Location:**
- `/frontend/src/components/Events/` directory

**Conclusion:** The event management system implements core functionality without premium or advanced features that would exceed typical alumni management scope.

### 3. Job Management

**Details:**
- Standard job posting functionality
- Job application tracking
- Company profiles management
- Role-based access control
- No premium job listing or payment functionality

**Code Location:**
- `/frontend/src/components/Jobs/` directory

**Conclusion:** The job management system focuses on core alumni career services without premium features or payment integrations.

## Database Schema Review

A comprehensive review of the database schema revealed:
- Standard tables for alumni profile management, events, jobs, groups, connections
- No tables supporting advanced features like payments, subscriptions, or AI/ML
- No evidence of gamification systems (points, rewards, leaderboards)

## Not Found in Codebase

The following potentially out-of-scope features were explicitly searched for but NOT found:

1. **Payment Processing Systems**
   - No Stripe or other payment gateway integration
   - No subscription management
   - No premium content gating

2. **Gamification Systems**
   - No point systems, badges (beyond simple UI status indicators), or rewards
   - No leaderboards or ranking systems
   - No achievement tracking beyond basic profile achievements

3. **Advanced AI/ML Features**
   - No sophisticated recommendation engines
   - No content personalization algorithms
   - No predictive analytics
   - No automated content generation

## Conclusion

The audit identified two potential out-of-scope features that may require review:

1. **OAuth Social Login** - If social login options were not explicitly approved
2. **Two-Factor Authentication** - If advanced security features were not part of the plan

All other examined components appear to align with the standard scope of alumni management systems, focusing on core alumni networking, events, job opportunities, and basic mentorship features without advanced or premium functionality.

## Recommendations

1. Review the approved Alumni Management Plan to confirm if OAuth and 2FA were included
2. If not included, consider:
   - Disabling social login options
   - Simplifying the authentication system by removing 2FA
3. Document any approved exceptions to the original plan
4. Implement a feature flag system for borderline features to easily enable/disable based on stakeholder decisions
