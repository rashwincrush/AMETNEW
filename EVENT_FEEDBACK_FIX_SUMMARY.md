# Event Feedback Feature Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the issues encountered with the Event Feedback feature and the solutions implemented to fix them.

## Issues Identified

1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: 
   - The frontend was referencing a non-existent `would_recommend` column in the `event_feedback` table
   - The frontend was using `created_at` instead of the actual `submitted_at` timestamp field
   - The frontend was incorrectly using `event_rsvps` table when the actual table name in the database is `event_attendees`
   - The RSVP status values were inconsistent ('going' vs 'registered')

2. **Inefficient Data Fetching**:
   - Complex nested queries were causing 400 and 406 errors from Supabase
   - Attendee fetching was using an incorrect foreign key relationship syntax

3. **Mock Data Generation**:
   - Unnecessary mock data generation code was adding complexity and potential errors

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created SQL View for Efficient Feedback Querying
Created a `detailed_event_feedback` view that joins the necessary tables:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW detailed_event_feedback AS
SELECT 
  ef.id AS feedback_id,
  ef.event_id,
  ef.user_id,
  ef.rating,
  ef.comments,
  ef.submitted_at AS feedback_submitted_at,
  e.title AS event_title,
  p.full_name,
  p.avatar_url
FROM 
  event_feedback ef
JOIN 
  events e ON ef.event_id = e.id
JOIN 
  profiles p ON ef.user_id = p.id;
```

### 2. Fixed Frontend Components

#### EventFeedback.js
- Removed non-existent `would_recommend` field and related UI components
- Updated timestamp field from `created_at` to `submitted_at` to match database schema
- Simplified form submission logic

#### EventFeedbackDashboard.js
- Updated to use the new `detailed_event_feedback` view
- Removed obsolete statistics calculations for the non-existent `would_recommend` field
- Removed mock data generation code
- Fixed CSV export to exclude non-existent columns
- Updated UI to remove "Would Recommend" section

#### EventDetail.js
- Fixed `fetchAttendees` function to use a two-step query approach:
  1. First fetch RSVPs with status "registered" from the correct `event_attendees` table
  2. Then fetch profiles for those users
  3. Combine the data client-side
- Fixed `fetchUserRsvp` function to use the correct `event_attendees` table
- Updated all references to the incorrect `event_rsvps` table to use `event_attendees`
- Updated the `handleRsvp` function to use consistent status values ('registered' instead of 'going')
- Fixed the database table name in the `handleDelete` function

## Additional Schema Alignment Fixes

After fixing the basic table name issue (`event_rsvps` â†’ `event_attendees`), we discovered additional column name mismatches in the EventDetail.js file:

1. **Column Name Mismatches**:
   - Changed `user_id` to `attendee_id` to match the schema
   - Changed `status` to `attendance_status` 
   - Changed `created_at` to `registration_date`
   - Updated profile select columns (`job_title` and `company` instead of `current_position` and `current_company`)

2. **Status Value Alignment**:
   - Changed status values to match database expectations
   - Using `registered` and `canceled` instead of `going` and `not_going`

These additional fixes ensure that the frontend is fully aligned with the actual database schema as defined in supabase_schema.sql.

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Improved Reliability**: No more 400/406 errors from Supabase queries
2. **Better Performance**: More efficient queries with the SQL view
3. **Code Simplicity**: Removed unnecessary mock data and complex query logic
4. **Data Integrity**: Frontend now correctly aligns with the actual database schema

## Future Considerations

1. **Error Handling**: Consider adding more robust error handling and user feedback
2. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for the feedback submission and viewing flows
3. **Analytics**: Consider adding more detailed analytics for event feedback data

## Documentation Updates
- Updated `FEATURE_STATUS.md` to reflect the changes and current status
