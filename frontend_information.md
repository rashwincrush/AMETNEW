```

The application follows a modular structure organized by feature area rather than by technical function.

### Routing System

Routes are defined in App.js with a nested structure using React Router. Protected routes use the `ProtectedRoute` component to enforce authentication and authorization.

---

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### User Roles

The system implements the following roles in hierarchical order:

1. `super_admin` - System-wide administrative access
2. `admin` - Administrative access with some limitations
3. `moderator` - Content moderation capabilities
4. `employer` - Company/job posting access
5. `alumni` - AMET alumni access
6. `student` - Current student access
7. `user` - Basic user access

### RBAC Implementation

The RBAC system is implemented through several key components:

#### 1. AuthContext (`/contexts/AuthContext.js`)

- Central authentication management
- User role determination logic with hierarchy
- Permission checking methods:
  - `hasPermission(permissionName)`
  - `hasAnyPermission(permissionArray)`
  - `hasAllPermissions(permissionArray)`
- Profile fetching from Supabase profiles table
- Session management

```javascript
// Role determination logic
const getUserRole = useCallback(() => {
  if (!profile && !user) return 'alumni';
  
  // Check profile role first
  if (profile?.role) {
    if (profile.role === 'super_admin') return 'super_admin';
    if (profile.role === 'admin') return 'admin';
    if (profile.role === 'moderator') return 'moderator';
    if (profile.role === 'employer') return 'employer';
    if (profile.role) return profile.role;
  }
  
  // Fallbacks
  if (profile?.email?.includes('@amet.ac.in') && profile?.is_admin) {
    return 'admin';
  }
  
  if (profile?.is_employer) {
    return 'employer';
  }
  
  return user?.user_metadata?.role || 'alumni';
}, [profile, user]);
```

#### 2. PermissionGate (`/components/PermissionGate.js`)

- UI-level permission control component
- Conditionally renders children based on user permissions
- Supports single or multiple permission checks
- Can require all permissions or any permission

```javascript
// PermissionGate usage example
<PermissionGate 
  permissions="manage_roles"
  fallback={<AccessDeniedMessage />}
>
  <AdminContent />
</PermissionGate>
```

#### 3. ProtectedRoute Component

- Route-level access control
- Redirects unauthorized users
- Supports role-based route protection
- Integrates with React Router

#### 4. Role Management (`/components/Admin/RoleManagement.js`)

- Admin interface for user role management
- Displays users with filters for role and verification status
- Role update capabilities through modal interface
- Protected by `manage_roles` permission
