# Alumni Application: Features and Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of the Alumni Application, including its features, frontend architecture, and backend infrastructure.

## Backend Architecture

The backend is powered by **Supabase**, an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a suite of tools to build applications quickly.

*   **Database:** A **PostgreSQL** database is used for data storage. Supabase provides a user-friendly interface for managing the database schema, tables, and relationships.
*   **Authentication:** Supabase handles user authentication, supporting email/password-based sign-ups, logins, and secure password recovery. It also manages user roles and permissions through its built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
*   **APIs:** Supabase automatically generates a RESTful API for the database, allowing the frontend to interact with the data through simple and secure HTTP requests. Realtime capabilities are also available for features like messaging and notifications.
*   **File Storage:** Supabase Storage is used for managing user-generated content, such as profile pictures and resumes.

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a modern single-page application (SPA) built with **React**.

*   **Framework:** **React** is the core library for building the user interface.
*   **Routing:** **React Router** is used for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different pages and components without full-page reloads.
*   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling, providing a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **State Management:**
    *   **React Context API** is used for managing global state, such as user authentication.
    *   **TanStack Query (React Query)** is used for managing server state, including data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the backend.
*   **Key Libraries:**
    *   **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the backend.
    *   **date-fns / moment:** For date and time manipulation.
    *   **React Big Calendar:** For the events calendar view.
    *   **Headless UI / Heroicons:** For accessible and unstyled UI components.
